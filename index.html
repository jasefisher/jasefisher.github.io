		<h2>Hello and Welcome</h2>
		
		<h4>A bit about me</h4>
		
		<p>
			I am a long-time developer and all around general IT guy. I don't do much with networks and hardware, but I have done almost
			all the other things in the business of software development.
		</p>

		<p>
			From working with dBase III back in the early 90's to writing full-featured web applications with SQL Server and 
			ColdFusion through the Allaire and Macromedia and Adobe days to consulting as a business analyst to running an entire IT
			department, I have been seen most aspects of the business up close.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once I got into web application development back in the late 90's, I rarely looked back. I like databases and database design,
			but bringing everything to the user in useful ways has always been the aspect I like the most.
